This information is made available to students in the program via Canvas, but is hosted here as an external resource. Students in the course should refer to the official course information on Canvas.\nWhat is the Computational Core? The Computational Core is a set of computer programming courses designed to provide students of any major with the fundamental knowledge to utilize programming in a variety of situations. Programming is the skillset that makes students stand out in the 21st century job market and is beneficial in almost any field. The Computational Core includes high quality, state-of-the-art courses that are scalable and self-sustaining. These courses use cutting-edge online education frameworks allow students to work at their own pace, require students to master basic concepts before advancing, and provide immediate feedback and guidance while retaining personal interaction with teaching faculty and teaching assistants.\nCertificate courses include:\nCC 110 - Introduction to Computing\nCC 210 – Fundamental Computer Programming Concepts\nCC 310 – Data Structures \u0026 Algorithms\nCC 315 – Data Structures \u0026 Algorithms 2\nCC 410 – Advanced Programming\nAdditional courses are currently in development as part of a planned Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science. These courses will cover more advanced topics such as web development, data science, system administration, and database systems. More information regarding that program will be available in 2020.\nFree Sample Course Are you a K-State student with interest in computer science but not sure if this program is right for you? Fill out this brief questionnaire to sign up for a free sample course designed to introduce you to the program. The sample course includes the first module of CC 210 - Fundamental Computer Programming Concepts, as well as a look at the structure that is common across all Computational Core courses. At this time, the sample course is available only to current K-State students with a valid eID.\nSign Up Sign up for the Undergraduate Certificate in Computer Science.\nMore Information Learm more about the Undergraduate Minor and Certificate in CS.\nVisit the Computer Science Programs page from K-State Global Campus\nFor information on how to integrate the Computational Core into your department’s curriculum, please contact Scott DeLoach (sdeloach@ksu.edu).",
