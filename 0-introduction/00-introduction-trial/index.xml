    <title>Trial Introduction :: K-State Computational Core</title>
    <link>https://core.cs.ksu.edu/0-introduction/00-introduction-trial/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script Greetings, and welcome to the trial course for the Computational Core program!&#xA;My name is Russell Feldhausen, and am one of the instructors for this program. My contact information is shown here. My email address is russfeld@ksu.edu, and it is by far my preferred method of communication if you need to reach me directly.&#xA;This trial course contains two modules from our CC 210: Fundamental Computer Programming Concepts course - the introductory module describing the content and the structure of the course, as well as the first module teaching how to write a “Hello World” program in the chosen programming language.</description>
