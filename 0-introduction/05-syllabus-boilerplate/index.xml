    <title>Syllabus Boilerplate :: K-State Computational Core</title>

    <description>Late Work Warning Read this late work policy very carefully! If you are unsure how to interpret it, please contact the instructors via Piazza. Not understanding the policy does not mean that it wonâ€™t apply to you!&#xA;Since this course is entirely online, students may work at any time and at their own pace through the modules. However, to keep everyone on track, there will be approximately one module due each week.</description>
