    <title>Codio Videos :: K-State Computational Core</title>
    <link>https://core.cs.ksu.edu/0-introduction/07-codio-videos/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video Welcome to Codio! For this class, weâ€™ll be using Codio in a couple of different ways. First, the course textbook will consist of several tutorials built in Codio using the same Guide interface that you are using right now. Secondly, most of the programming projects in this course will also be handled through Codio. Codio has many unique features, including a fully online development environment and automatic grading that make this course scalable and accessible.</description>
