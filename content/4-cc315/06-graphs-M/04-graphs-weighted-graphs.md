[Slide 1]

The next portion of this module will cover specific types of graphs. The first we will discuss are weighted graphs. Weighted graphs are characterized by the edges of the graphs having values associated with them. These values can be monetary cost, distance, time, and more abstract things such as movie similarities, 


[Slide 2]

In this first example of a weighted graph, we have a segment of Japan's bullet train. Each node represents a station that the bullet train visits and each edge is the route between the stations. The edges in this example characterize the amount of time travelled between the stations. For example, the train ride from Osaka to Kyoto will be twenty eight minutes. 

Travellers can use this type of information to maximize their sightseeing while minimizing their travel time.
