[Slide 1]

The next data structure that we will cover are graphs. This data structure will appear in two modules as we will explore two implementations. In this first module, we will introduce the structure and the first implementation. We will cover the second implementation and compare the models in the second module. 


[Slide 2]

Graphs are a very versatile multidimensional data structure which can represent a wide variety of relational data sets. These data sets can range from physical data points, like cities and buildings, to more abstract data points, like friendships between people and web pages. Trees are also a type of graph but not all graphs are trees. Trees have more constraints than graphs as we will see in this module. 

[Slide 3]

The rest of this module will cover the following topics. We will discuss key terms and features, some special types of graphs, and the first implementation along with its UML diagram. Once we have completed this, we will begin our first graph project.
