[Slide 1]

Since trees are a type of graph, much of the vocabulary will be the same. For example, nodes will still be depicted a circles and edges will be depicted as lines connecting the nodes. Like trees, nodes can contain virtually anything, numbers, letters, and other data structures. Edges are not limited to just showing parent to child relationships in graphs. 


[Slide 2]

The edges are a key part of graphs which make them more versatile. Edges can show a wide variety of relationships like the connections between computer components, cities, and even people. 


[Slide 3]

In a graph, two nodes are said to be adjacent if there is an edge connecting them. The neighbors of a node are all of the nodes which are adjacent to it.
