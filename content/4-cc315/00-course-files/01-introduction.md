[Slide 2]

Hello, my name is Emily Alfs-Votipka and I would like to welcome you to the Computational Core program! 
I will be your instructor for CC315 this fall. 
My contact information is shown here, and is also listed on the syllabus. 
My email address is emilyalfs@ksu.edu and is my preferred method of communication if you need to reach me directly. 

[Slide 3]

For course related questions, please email the course help group which can be reached using your KSU email by typing cc315 and hit tab to auto complete.
If you are using an email other than your KSU address, please email the group email shown in the syllabus.


[Slide 4]

We’ll be using the online learning platform Codio for most of the programming tutorials and projects in this program. 
We’ll also discuss how to use Codio later in this module.

[Slide 6]

The Computational Core program consists of several courses, and each course contains a number of learning modules. 
In general, there are about 12 - 16 modules per course. 
Each module will usually consist of an interactive tutorial using Codio, followed by a quiz through Canvas, and lastly a programming project in Codio. 
The modules themselves are gated, which means that you must complete each item in the module in order before continuing. 
In addition, the modules enforce prerequisite requirements from other modules, so you may have to complete one or more modules before you can access a later module. 
While the modules may be completed in order, the prerequisites allow you to complete modules in any order you choose, provided you have completed the appropriate prerequisite modules.

You are welcome to work at your own pace throughout this course, provided that you complete each module before the listed due date.
There will be roughly one module due every Thursday at 7PM.

The modules are self-contained, and nearly all of the grading in this course is completed automatically through Canvas and Codio. 
So, you can complete modules as quickly or slowly as you’d like before the due date, and once a module is complete, you may immediately start on the next one.

[Slide 7]

Looking ahead to the rest of this introductory module, you’ll see that there are a few more items to be completed before you can move on. 
In the next video, I’ll discuss a bit more information about navigating through this course on Canvas and using the Codio learning environment.

One thing I highly encourage each of you to do is read the syllabus for this course in its entirety, and let us know if you have any questions.

[Slide 8]

My view is that the syllabus is a contract between me as your teacher and you as a student, defining how each of us should treat each other and what we should expect from each other. 
We have made a few changes to the standard syllabus template for this program, and those changes are clearly highlighted. 
Finally, the syllabus itself is subject to change as needed as we adapt this program to meet the needs of its students, and all changes will be clearly communicated to everyone before they take effect.

[Slide 9]

One very important part of the syllabus that every student should read is the late work policy. 
First off, each module has a due date, but you can work on that module at your own pace provided you complete it before it is due. 
As discussed before, you must do all the readings and assignments in a module in listed order before moving on, so you cannot jump ahead. 
A module is considered completed when all items have been completed.

For the purposes of grading, we will use the date and time that the confirmation quiz was submitted at the end of each module to determine when the module was completed. 
This is due to the way that Codio handles automated grading, as it may resubmit previously graded assignments if an error in the module is corrected, making a previously completed assignment appear to be submitted late.

The late policy for this course will be as follows: for every 24 hours after the due date, up to 72 hours, a penalty of 10% of the total points in that module will be subtracted from the score received on that module. After 72 hours, a grade of 0 will be given.

For example, modules are due on Thursdays at 7PM so you can earn up to: 
- 100% of the grade by turning it in on Thursday before or at 7PM
- 90% of the grade by turning it in on or before Friday at 7PM
- 80% of the grade by turning it in on or before Saturday at 7PM
- 70% of the grade by turning it in on or before Sunday at 7PM
- 0% after Sundays at 7PM

So, even if some of the module’s work was completed before the due date, the penalty will still be assessed on all work in that module, regardless of when it was completed.
Finally, even if a module is late, it still must be completed before you can move on to a later module. 
So, it is very important to avoid getting behind in this course, as it can be very difficult to get back on track. 
If you ever find that you are struggling to keep up, please don’t be afraid to contact me for assistance. I would be happy to help you get caught back up quickly.

[Slide 10]

The grading in this course is very simple. 
First, 70% of your final grade will depend on the grades you receive from each of the Codio projects in the course. 
Then, 30% of your grade will come from the interactive tutorials in Codio and quizzes for each module. 
Finally, the last 20% of your grade will come from the quizzes for each module. 
In this program, the standard “90-80-70-60” grading scale will apply, though I reserve the right to curve grades up to a higher grade level at my discretion. 
Therefore, you will never be required to get higher than 90% for an A, but you may get an A if you score slightly below 90% if I choose to curve the grades.

[Slide 11]

Since this is a completely online, self-paced course, you may be asking yourself what is different about this course. 
First, there are no scheduled course times. 
All of the content is available online, so you can work whenever and wherever you want. 
It could be a 3-hour block once a week, or a few minutes here and there between classes. It’s really up to you and your schedule. 
However, remember that each module may require 9 - 12 or more hours of work to complete, so make sure you have plenty of time available to devote to this course.
Also, a vast majority of the grading in this course will be handled automatically through Canvas and Codio. 
This means that you’ll be able to receive feedback directly from those systems as soon as you submit your work. 
You may also contact the instructor for additional tips and feedback regarding your work, but depending on the number of students in the program, I may not be able to review every student submission directly.
In addition, due to the flexible online format of this class, there won’t be any long lecture videos to watch. 
Instead, each module will consist of a guided tutorial and several short videos, each focused on a particular topic or task. 
Likewise, there won’t be any textbooks required, since all of the information will be presented in the interactive tutorials through Codio. 
Finally, since we are using Codio as our learning platform, you won’t have to deal with installing and using a clunky integrated development environment, or IDE, just to learn how to program. 
Codio helps make learning to program quick and painless by moving everything to the web.

[Slide 12]

What hasn’t changed, though, is the basic concept of a college course. 
You’ll still be expected to watch or read about 6 hours of content to complete each module. 
In addition to that, each project assignment may require another 6 hours of work to complete. 
If you plan on doing two modules each week, that roughly equates to 12 hours of content and 12 hours of homework each week, which is the expected workload from a 3-4 credit hour 8 week college course.

[Slide 13]

For this course, the only supplies you’ll need as a student are access to a modern web browser and a broadband internet connection. No other special hardware or software is necessary!

[Slide 14]

Finally, as you are aware, this course is always subject to change. 
This is a relatively new program here at K-State, and we’re always working on new and interesting ideas to integrate into the courses. The best advice I have is to keep calm and ask for help as you need it! We are here to help you be successful in the program. 

[Slide 15]

So, to complete this module, there are a few other things that you’ll need to do. The next step is to watch the video on navigating Canvas and Codio, which will give you a good idea of how to most effectively work through the content in this course.
