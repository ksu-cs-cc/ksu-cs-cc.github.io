[Slide 1]

To be able to work with tree and really understand them, we will start with some vocabulary. The first that we will cover are nodes and edges. 

[Slide 2]

Nodes, which we depict visually as circles, are the structures which contain the data. The data can be characters, strings, files, or any data structure. 

[Slide 3]

Edges, which we depict as arrows, connect two nodes together. These arrows will be 'directed' to show the relationship between two nodes. This relationship is referred to as a parent child relationship.

[Slide 4]

Much like a family tree, the arrows will connect parents, the node at the flat end of the arrow, with their children, the pointed end of the arrow. Parents can have many children. However, each child must have at most one parent. In a later video, we will discuss counterexamples of trees to reinforce this idea.  


[Slide 5]

The root of a tree is a special type of node; it is a node with no parent. The root is also typically depicted as the topmost node, this is just a rule of thumb. Tree's will have exactly one root. 

[Slide 6]

Another special type of node that are present in trees are leaves. A leaf is defined as a node with no children. There can be any number leaves in a tree. Leaves will not necessarily be at the same level or distance from the root. 

[Slide ]

Each node has a property called the degree. The degree of a node is simply the number of children.

[Slide ]

Trees are defined recursively. This means that a tree is made up of other trees.
