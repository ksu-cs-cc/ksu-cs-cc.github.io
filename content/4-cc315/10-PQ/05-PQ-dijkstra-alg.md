[Slide 1]

A classic implementation of priority queues is Dijkstra's algorithm. This function will find the shortest path from a given source node to any other node in a graph. This is a Greedy algorithm as we are trying to get the locally smallest edge to eventually get the globally shortest path.

Here we have outlined the algorithm for Dijkstra.

Here's an example.
