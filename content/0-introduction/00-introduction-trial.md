Greetings, and welcome to the trial course for the Computational Core program!

My name is Russell Feldhausen, and am one of the instructors for this program. My contact information is shown here. My email address is russfeld@ksu.edu, and it is by far my preferred method of communication if you need to reach me directly.

This trial course contains two modules from our CC 210: Fundamental Computer Programming Concepts course - the introductory module describing the content and the structure of the course, as well as the first module teaching how to write a "Hello World" program in the chosen programming language. In addition, you'll have access to both Piazza and Codio, two of the tools we use in all of our Computational Core courses. So, you're really getting access to the exact same resources and tools we use in the real class. Our hope is to give you a quick introduction to the course and help you decide if it is right for you, without having to go through the hassle of enrolling and dropping later.

This course is part of a larger set of courses making up an Undergraduate Certificate in Computer Science. Right now the certificate contains four courses, with a fifth course being added in the coming year. Our plan is to start teaching CC 210 in Fall 2019, with CC 310 following in Spring 2020. By Fall 2020, we plan to have all 5 courses available, and will teach them every following semester and summer session.

In addition, we are planning to use these courses in several other areas. First, we are working on a proposal for an Applied Computer Science degree, which will be announced in the coming months. We also plan on making these courses available to high schools in the area, as well as provide teacher training for teachers who wish to use these courses in their classrooms. Finally, we are exploring ways to provide this information to industry partners in the form of professional development training. So, we'll constantly be iterating and improving these courses as we go.

If you have any questions or comments about this program, our plans, or this trial course, we'd love to hear from you! Please feel free to email me directly at russfeld@ksu.edu. You may also contact our department directly at csoffice@ksu.edu. If you are interested in taking these courses, applying them to your major, or are looking for ways to integrate these courses into other areas, we'd be happy to help make it happen.

Once again, thank you for giving this new course a try. From here on out, you'll be experiencing the same content that students in CC 210 would see. Click the Next button at the bottom of this page to continue to the next video. Good luck, and happy coding!
