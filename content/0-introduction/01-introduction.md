Greetings, and welcome to the Computational Core program!

My name is Russell Feldhausen, and I'll be the primary instructor for this program. My contact information is shown here, and is also listed on the syllabus. My email address is russfeld@ksu.edu, and it is by far my preferred method of communication if you need to reach me directly.

There are many other instructors and TAs for this program that you may interact with or see in the tutorial videos. They all have been instrumental in the development of this program.

For this program, we'll be using Piazza as our primary communication tool. So, if you have any questions or concerns regarding this course, please use Piazza instead of email to contact me or the other instructors. We'll cover how to access and use Piazza later in this module. Once you are on Piazza, you can find short introductions from myself and each of the other instructors and TAs, and you'll also be invited to post your own introduction.

In addition, we'll be using the online learning platform Codio for most of the programming tutorials and projects in this program. We'll also discuss how to use Codio later in this module.

The Computational Core program consists of several courses, and each course contains a number of learning modules. In general, there are about 15 to 20 modules per course. Each module will usually consist of an interactive tutorial using Codio, followed by a quiz through Canvas, and lastly a programming project in Codio. The modules themselves are gated, which means that you much complete each item in the module in order before continuing. In addition, the modules enforce prerequisite requirements from other modules, so you may have to complete one or more modules before you can access a later module. While the modules may be completed in order, the prerequisites allow you to complete modules in any order you choose, provided you have completed the appropriate prerequisite modules.

You are welcome to work at your own pace throughout this course. The modules are self-contained, and nearly all of the grading in this course is completed automatically through Canvas and Codio. So, you can complete modules as quickly or slowly as you'd like, and once a module is complete, you may immediately start on the next one.

Looking ahead to the rest of this first module, you'll see that there are a few more items to be completed before you can move on. In the next video, I'll discuss a bit more information about navigating through this course on Canvas and Piazza, and using the Codio learning environment.

One thing I highly encourage each of you to do is read the syllabus for this course in its entirety, and let me know if you have any questions. My view is that the syllabus is a contact between me as your teacher and you as a student, defining how each of us should treat each other and what we should expect from each other. I have made a few changes to the standard syllabus template for this program, and those changes are clearly highlighted. Finally, the syllabus itself is subject to change as needed as we adapt this program to meet the needs of its students, and all changes will be clearly communicated to everyone before they take effect.

The grading in this course is very simple. First, 60% of your final grade will depend on the grades you receive from each of the Codio projects in the course. Next, 20% of your grade will come from the interactive tutorials in Codio. Finally, the last 20% of your grade will come from the quizzes for each module. In this program, the standard "90-80-70-60" grading scale will apply, though I reserve the right to curve grades up to a higher grade level at my discretion. Therefore, you will never be required to get higher than 90% for an A, but you may get an A if you score slightly below 90% if I choose to curve the grades.

Since this is a completely online, self-paced course, you may be asking yourself what is different about this course. First off, there are no due dates! You can work at your own pace, and turn in work whenever you like. However, as discussed before, you must do all the readings and assignments in order before moving on, so you cannot jump ahead. Because of that, there is no established policy for late work. The only deadline is the last day of the semester you are enrolled in, as grades must be posted to KSIS shortly after that deadline.

Also, a vast majority of the grading in this course will be handled automatically through Canvas and Codio. This means that you'll be able to receive feedback directly from those systems as soon as you submit your work. You may also contact the instructors and TAs for additional tips and feedback regarding your work, but depending on the number of students in the program, we may not be able to review every student submission directly.

In addition, due to the flexible online format of this class, there won't be any long lecture videos to watch. Instead, each module will consist of several short videos, each focused on a particular topic or task. Likewise, there won't be any textbooks required, since all of the information will be presented in the interactive tutorials through Codio. Finally, since we are using Codio as our learning platform, you won't have to deal with installing and using a clunky integrated development environment, or IDE, just to learn how to program. Codio helps make learning to program quick and painless by moving everything to the web.

What hasn't changed, though, is the basic concept of a college course. You'll still be expected to watch or read about 4 hours of content to complete each module. In addition to that, each project assignment may require anywhere from 2 to 4 hours of work to complete. If you plan on doing a module every few days, that roughly equates to 3 hours of content and 3 hours of homework each week, which is the expected workload from a 3 credit hour college course.

For this course, the only supplies you'll need as a student are access to a modern web browser and a broadband internet connection. No other special hardware or software is necessary!

Finally, as you are aware, this course is always subject to change. This is a relatively new program here at K-State, and we're always working on new and interesting ideas to integrate into the courses. The best advice I have is to look upon this graphic with the words "Don't Panic" written in large, friendly letters, and remember that it'll all work out in the end as long as you know where your towel is.

So, to complete this module, there are a few other things that you'll need to do. The next step is to watch the video on navigating Canvas, Piazza, and Codio, which will give you a good idea of how to most effectively work through the content in this course.
