#### Computer Science Undergraduate Certificate

Now that you've completed this trial course, please consider signing up for our Undergraduate Certificate in Computer Science. We believe that teaching computer science to everyone is an important mission, and that those programming skills are in high demand in the workplace now and in the future.

We interviewed folks from several local companies to get their perspective on the importance of programming in the modern workplace and how each of them ended up in a role that includes programming. Their answers may surprise you! Check out the video above to see what we learned!
