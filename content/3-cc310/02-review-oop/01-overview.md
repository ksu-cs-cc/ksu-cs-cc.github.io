Slide 2

This is the second review module for CC 310. In this model we'll look at higher level programming concepts related to object-oriented programming. Again, most of this should be review.

We will start off the module by looking at these concepts at an abstract level. We'll cover some basic definitions and examples using the Unified Modeling Language, or UML. After our conceptual overview, we will then review how these concepts are implemented in a programming language.

Specifically, we will look at the concepts of classes and objects and talk about how we use them to encapsulate data and behavior. We will also discuss how encapsulation enables us to hide information in order to make our programs easier to understand and more reliable.

Next, we will look at how we can use inheritance to implement code reuse in a principled and organized manner.

Then, we will look at the concept of associations between classes. Associations are probably new to most of you, although it is fairly simple concept. It basically formalizes the notion of storing references to objects within other objects to allow them to call each other's methods and access their attributes.

Finally, we'll review the model-view-controller architecture. As you recall, the MVC architecture helps us organize our code to make it easier to develop, maintain, and document.

Slide 3

To complete this module, you will need to successfully carry out the MVC exercise at the end of the module. If you can do that without spending much time in the other parts of the module, fine. However, I would still urge you to read over the first few sections to make sure you understand the key object-oriented concepts and at least skim the sections on how to implement those concepts in code.

If, however, you're like most of us, a thorough review of this material will only make you a stronger programming and give you more confidence as you move through the rest of the course.

Remember, if you struggle with any part of the MVC exercise, that's a strong indicator that there are some concepts you don't fully understand. Don't try to continue on and just get through it. If you want to be successful in CC 310 it is very important that you understand the concepts in this module.

Again, if you find yourself struggling with some of the concepts, I urge you to review these concepts in more depth by going back to the CC 210 textbook, which is available to you from Canvas.
