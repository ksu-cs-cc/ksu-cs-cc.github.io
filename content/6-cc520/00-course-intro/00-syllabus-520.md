### Required Software

We will be utilizing MS SQL Server for this course.  For information about accessing SQL Server for the course, see [SQL Server Access](https://k-state.instructure.com/courses/116923/pages/sql-server-access). 

### Course Overview

Introduction to concepts and techniques in database management. Overview of relational databases, NoSQL databases, and related topics. Database programming and use of databases in applications. Theory and architecture of database management systems (DBMS).

### Course Description

The purpose of this course is to introduce concepts, approaches, and techniques in database management. This includes exploring the representation of information as data, data storage techniques, foundations of data models, data retrieval, database design, transaction management, integrity and security.

### Student Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, a successful student will be able to:
* Write and read SQL, including queries, relations, database modifications, constraints, triggers, transactions, and views.
* Recognize the difference between NoSQL and its philosophy compared to SQL.
* Design and create databases utilizing entity relationship models, functional dependencies, and normalization.
* Design queries and databases that are optimized in storage, retrieval, and processing of data.
* Create an application that utilizes a database.

### Major Course Topics

* SQL Language
* NoSQL & its relation to SQL
* DBMS design theory
* Programming with databases
* Database system architecture
* Database efficiency
* Practical applications of databases

###  Course Structure
This course is taught 100% online.  There will be periodic due dates for modules in order to assist with time management and to keep the class in sync.  There may be some bumps in the road as we refine the overall course structure. Material will be provided in the form of recorded videos, online tutorials, links to online resources, and discussion prompts. Each module will include a coding (SQL) project or assignment. Assignments may include portions which will be graded manually via Canvas or other tools and some potions that are auto-graded.

A common axiom in learner-centered teaching is **"the person doing the work is the person doing the learning."** What this really means is that students primarily learn through grappling with the concepts and skills of a course while attempting to apply them. Simply seeing a demonstration or hearing a lecture by itself doesn’t do much in terms of learning. This is not to say that they don't serve an important role - as they set the stage for the learning to come, helping you to recognize the core ideas to focus on as you work. The work itself consists of applying ideas, practicing skills, and putting the concepts into your own words.

### Grading
There will be two midterm exams and one final exam for the course. Students will be evaluated based on exams, homework assignments, and a term project. Students are highly encouraged to attend every lecture (either in-person or online) and to participate in discussion. 

Assignments are to be completed without any collaboration with classmates or other outside help unless otherwise stated. Any unauthorized aid may result in a 0 for the assignment or an XF for the course and a report submitted to the Academic Honor Council. All assignments will be submitted through Canvas. The specific grading scheme is shown below:

- Quizzes: 50%
- Homework assignments: 25%
- Final Project: 25%
#### Late Work

{{% notice warning%}}

Poor planning/procrastination on your part does not constitute as an emergency on ours.

{{% /notice %}}

Every student should strive to turn in work on time. **Late work will receive penalty of 1% of the possible points for each partial hour it is late**. Some assignments will NOT be accepted late! Others will be limited to a maximum of three days late (not always 3 days).

## Subject to Change

The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum.
