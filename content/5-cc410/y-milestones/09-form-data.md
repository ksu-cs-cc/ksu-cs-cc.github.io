This page lists the milestone requirements for **Milestone 9** of the **CC 410 Restaurant Project**. Read the requirements carefully and discuss any questions with the instructors or TAs. 

## Purpose

The **CC 410 Restaurant Project** project for this semester is centered around building a point of sale (POS) system for a fictional restaurant named _Starfleet Subs_, based in the [Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek) universe. 

The eighth milestone involves moving into the web by creating a data-driven website to display the menu and some other information about the restaurant.

## General Requirements

This milestone must follow these professional coding standards:

* **All code must be object-oriented.**
  * All executable code must be within a class
    * Python package files such as `__init__.py` and `__main__.py` are exempt.
  * Classes must be organized into packages based on common usage.
* **This project must include automation for compilation, unit testing, style checking, documentation generation, and execution.**
  * Java: Use Gradle with the `application` plugin. The project should compile without errors.
  * Python: Use tox configured to use Python 3.6 and a requirements file to install libraries.
* **All code must properly compile or be interpreted.**
  * Java: It must compile using Gradle.
  * Python: It must be interpreted using Python 3.6. Where specified, type hints should be included in the code, and all code should pass a strict Mypy type check with low imprecision percentage.
* **Where specified, code should contain appropriate unit tests that achieve the specified level of code coverage.**
  * Java: Use JUnit 5. You may choose to use Hamcrest for assertions.
  * Python: Use pytest. You may choose to use Hamcrest for assertions.
* **Where specified, code should contain appropriate documentation comments following the language's style guide.**
  * Java: Use javadoc to generate documentation.
  * Python: Use pdoc3 to generate documentation.
* **All code submitted must be free of style errors.** We will be using the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) for each language. 
  * Java: Use Checkstyle 8.38+ and the [Google Style Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/checkstyle-8.38/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml). 
    * You may modify the configuration to allow 4 space indentations instead of 2 space indentations.
  * Python: Use Flake8 with the `flake8-docstrings` and `pep8-naming` plugins. Code should conform to PEP 8 style with Google style docstrings. 
  * **All HTML Must Conform to the HTML5 Standard.** Use the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check your rendered pages if desired.
* Submissions to Canvas should be tagged GitHub releases that are numbered according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Assignment Requirements

Functionality:

* Simple search by keywords
* Advanced Search
  * Keywords
  * Item Type
  * Calories (Min / Max)
  * Price (Min / Max)

Forms should use HTTP POST Requests

Could be a single route or multiple routes

May use the search box on the Bootstrap form for simple search

Search functions implemented in `Menu` - should have some unit tests.

## Time Requirements

Completing this project is estimated to require **2 - 5** hours.

_A rough estimate for this milestone would be around !!TODO CHANGEME!! lines of new or updated code, the majority of which is HTML. -Russ_

## Grading Rubric

This assignment will be graded based on the rubric below:

!! TODO CHANGEME !!

The following deductions apply:

* Any portion of the project which will not compile (Java), pass a strict type check (Python), or execute properly will be given a grade of 0.

This is not an exhaustive list of possible deductions. The instructors will strive to provide reasonable and fair grading, but we can't predict all possible defects. It is up to the student to ensure that the project is complete and correct before submission. 

## Submission

Submit this assignment by creating a release on GitHub and uploading the release URL to the assignment on Canvas. You **should not** submit this Codio project or mark it as complete in Codio, in case you need to come back to it and make changes later.
