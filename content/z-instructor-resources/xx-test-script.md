Hello! My name is Russell Feldhausen, and it is my honor to serve as the Vice President of the All Souls Board of Trustees.

I'm here today to formally announce the All Souls Annual Meeting, as required by our constitution. Of course, while we must continue to fulfill our obligations, the current situation requires us be a bit more flexible and accepting of alternative ways of getting things done. I'm here to share our plan for holding an online virtual meeting. As many of you know, my career is in teaching, so this may feel a bit like school, but please bear with me as I explain what is going on.

As required by our constitution, we must hold an annual meeting of our society in May each year. The board has chosen to continue with the meeting as originally scheduled, which will be on May 17th at 1:00 PM. The meeting itself will be held online using Zoom, the same software we use for our Coffee and Conversation sessions throughout the week. The purpose of that meeting will be to adopt a provisional annual budget and elect incoming members of the board of trustees and various church committees. Since we are using Zoom, you'll be able to attend that meeting using a computer, tablet, or smartphone, or you can even call in using a regular telephone. 

To facilitate holding our annual meeting online, we have adopted a process to make sure every voting member is informed and able to cast a ballot. First, a physical letter from board president Andrea Jonson was mailed to all members during the week of April 8th, explaining our plan for the annual meeting and giving the slate of candidates for each position. If you haven't received yours yet, it should be coming soon. 

Next, on Monday, April 20th at Noon, an email will be sent to all certified voting members containing a link to a form we'd like you to fill out. That form asks if you are able to attend a virtual meeting on May 17th and if you have any comments. We'll use this form to help us determine if we can get a quorum of members present at the meeting on May 17th. If you do not receive this email but believe you should have, please send an email to board@allsoulskc.org and we will look into it.

Then, at the start of the annual meeting on May 17th, we will send a second email containing a link to a ballot form. That ballot must be submitted online within 1 hour of the end of the annual meeting in order for it to count as a vote cast at the meeting. However, if you run into any technology issues or prefer to cast a ballot via voice, you may call any board member to cast your ballot within that timeframe. We will then tabulate the results and share them as soon as they are available.

Here are some next steps you'll want to be aware of as we get closer to the annual meeting. First, the regular Board of Trustees meeting is this Wednesday, April 15th. During that meeting, we will create and approve an agenda for the annual meeting, as well as pass a provisional annual budget to be prestented to the congregation for approval. We'll also schedule a few virtual "church chats" to discuss the budget and answer any questions you may have before the annual meeting, just like we always do. 

On April 20th, please watch for an email from board@allsoulskc.org and fill out the linked form to indicate that you are able to attend the annual meeting online. Again, if you don't recieve that email and believe you should have, contact us at board@allsoulskc.org and we'll look into it.

Once the board has passed a budget for presentation at the annual meeting, please take some time to review it and plan on attending one of our virtual "church chats" if you have any questions or would like to discuss the budget with us.

Finally, mark your calendars for May 17th at 1:00 PM for the All Souls Annual Meeting! We hope to see you there. 

We hope that this process will allow everyone to attend the annual meeting and feel that their voice is heard. As always, if you have any questions, concerns, or comments, please email the board at board@allsoulskc.org or reach out to any board member.
