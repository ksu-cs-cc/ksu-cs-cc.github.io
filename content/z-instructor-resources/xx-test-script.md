Hello! My name is Russell Feldhausen, and it is my honor to serve as the Vice President of the All Souls Board of Trustees.

As required by article 4 of our constitution, we must hold an annual meeting of our society in May each year. This year's annual meeting will be Sunday, May 17th at 1:00 PM. The meeting itself will be held online using Zoom, the same software we use for our Coffee and Conversation sessions throughout the week. Since we are using Zoom, you'll be able to attend that meeting from home using a computer, tablet, or smartphone, or you can even call in using a regular telephone. The purpose of that meeting will be to adopt an annual budget and elect incoming members of the board of trustees and various church committees. We have chosen to postpone several other agenda items to a special meeting to be called later this year when we may meet again in person. 

You can find more information about the annual meeting, including the agenda and a proposed annual budget, in our church newsletter, on the website, or by contacting the church or any board member. We hope to see you there.

Hello! My name is Russell Feldhausen, and it is my honor to serve as the Vice President of the All Souls Board of Trustees.

I'm here today to share information about the All Souls Annual Meeting, as required by our constitution. Of course, while we must continue to fulfill our obligations, the current situation requires us be a bit more flexible and accepting of alternative ways of getting things done. I'm here to share our plan for holding an online virtual meeting. As many of you know, my career is in teaching, so this may feel a bit like school, but please bear with me as I explain what is going on.

As required by article 4 of our constitution, we must hold an annual meeting of our society in May each year. The board of trustees has chosen to continue with the meeting as originally scheduled, which will be on May 17th at 1:00 PM. The meeting itself will be held online using Zoom, the same software we use for our Coffee and Conversation sessions throughout the week. Since we are using Zoom, you'll be able to attend that meeting using a computer, tablet, or smartphone, or you can even call in using a regular telephone. The purpose of that meeting will be to adopt a annual budget and elect incoming members of the board of trustees and various church committees. We have chosen to postpone several other agenda items to a special meeting to be called later this year when we may meet again in person. 

To facilitate holding our annual meeting online, we have adopted a process to make sure every voting member is informed and able to cast a ballot. First, a physical letter from board president Andrea Jonson was mailed to all members during the week of April 8th, explaining our plan for the annual meeting and giving the slate of candidates for each position. If you haven't received yours yet, please contact us. 

Next, on Monday, April 20th at Noon, an email will be sent to all certified voting members containing a link to a form we'd like you to fill out. That form asks if you are able to attend a virtual meeting on May 17th and if you have any comments. We'll use this form to help us determine if we can get a quorum of members present at the meeting on May 17th. If you do not receive this email but believe you should have, please send an email to board@allsoulskc.org and we will look into it.

Then, at the start of the annual meeting on May 17th, we will send a second email containing a link to a ballot form. That ballot must be submitted online within 1 hour of the end of the annual meeting in order for it to count as a vote cast at the meeting. However, if you run into any technology issues or prefer to cast a ballot via voice, you may call any board member to cast your ballot within that timeframe. We will then tabulate the results and share them as soon as they are available.

Here are some next steps you'll want to be aware of as we get closer to the annual meeting. First, the met for their regular meeting on April 15th. During that meeting, we created and approved an agenda for the annual meeting, and also passed an annual budget from the finance committee to be prestented to the congregation for approval. Those documents will be shared via the church newsletter and on our website. We have also scheduled a few virtual "church chats" on April 26th and May 10th to discuss the budget and answer any questions you may have before the annual meeting, just like we always do. Those "church chats" will be held online via Zoom during the usual coffee and conversation hour following the online Sunday service. 

On April 20th, please watch for an email from board@allsoulskc.org and fill out the linked form to indicate that you are able to attend the annual meeting online. Again, if you don't recieve that email and believe you should have, contact us at board@allsoulskc.org and we'll look into it.

Please take some time to review the presented aganda and budget, and plan on attending one of our virtual "church chats" if you have any questions or would like to discuss the budget with us.

Finally, mark your calendars for May 17th at 1:00 PM for the All Souls Annual Meeting! We hope to see you there. 

We hope that this process will allow everyone to attend the annual meeting and feel that their voice is heard. As always, if you have any questions, concerns, or comments, please email the board at board@allsoulskc.org or reach out to any board member.
