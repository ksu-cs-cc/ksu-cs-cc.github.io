Good morning! My name is Russell Feldhausen. I am a member of this church, and currently serve as the vice president of the Board of Trustees. 

This week, we are commemorating one year since the last time we were able to be together in person for our Sunday service. It is a bittersweet anniversary for many of us as reflect on how much our lives have changed and all of the events we've missed over the past year. Thankfully, we may be starting to see the light at the end of the long tunnel.

During the time we've been apart, our church community has continued to grow, learn, and adapt to the new operating environment. Some items that come to mind for me are the continually amazing Sunday services, including the unique opportunity we had to partner with other churches during the summer; our continuing Sunday Plus lunches; the virtual chili cookoff; and the continued success of our many social groups and outreach teams. We're still doing great work together, even if we are at a distance.

Unfortunately, these times also present many challenges. For the second year in a row, we've been unable to hold our annual auction, a major fundraiser that helps fill the gap in our budget each year. The pandemic has made it difficult for groups to meet in person, and our income from rentals has been significantly reduced. 

Thankfully, through the hard work of our staff, volunteers, and the board, as well as the support of our members, we've been able to maintain our funding and continue to do all of these wonderful things. Just like we've all come to realize the importance of having a home that keeps us safe and comfortable during this pandemic, I feel like many of us have realized the importance of a spiritual home like All Souls to keep us energized and together, virtually if not in person. 

Your support is what allows this church to continue to grow and change, and there are several ways you can help. If you have a pledge on record, please make sure it is accurate, and update it if needed. If you give regularly, or would like to, having a pledge on record helps us build our annual budget and plan for the future. Both of these steps are easier than ever with our new online system - you might even say it's a breeze! You can find the link to add or update your pledge in the March newsletter, or feel free to contact the church or the board if you need assistance. 

And, of course, you can give to these Sunday collections that support the All Souls general fund. So today, join me in celebrating our virtual, spiritual home at All Souls with your generous support, in the hope that we'll be able to be together in person again soon. The offering will now be given and gratefully received.
