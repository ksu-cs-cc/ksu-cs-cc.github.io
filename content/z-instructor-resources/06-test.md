Good morning! My name is Russell Feldhausen. I am a member of this church, and currently serve as the vice president of the Board of Trustees. I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome our new members, as well as any visitors joining us today. I'm glad you are here with us. 

Over the past few months, our church community has grown, learned, and adapted in order to stay connected and relevant during this pandemic. Our staff have adapted to different working situations, and taken on new and important responsibilities. We've continued to offer regular worship services online, opportunities for fellowship and learning, and were even able to celebrate both Rebecca's ordination and the 40th anniversary of Kendyl's ordination, all within the span of a single week! So, with some hard work and dedication, we are continuing to "inspire personal and spiritual growth."

At the same time, our community is actively involved in advocating for social and racial justice and change. The Hunger Outreach Team has been busier than ever, providing meals to those who need them in our community. Several members also helped form the "UU KC Justice Action Group" to discuss ways we can affect great and positive changes in our local area. Please consider joining us for coffee and conversation after the service today to learn more about this important work. Through these actions, among many, many others, we are always working to "build a respectful, caring community" and "create a just and compassionate society". 

I ask you to consider this morning: how does All Souls help enrich you and your life? Is it the moving and insightful services? Our exceptional religious education program? The beautiful music we enjoy each week? The opportunities for fellowship and community? A community advocating and supporting just causes? Let's take a few moments to reflect on how All Souls impacts our lives and our community...

Unfortunately, the pandemic has also changed the facts about how our church is able to support itself. We were unable to have our annual auction, a major fundraiser for the church and an event that many of us look forward to each year. There are fewer groups renting our spaces, leaving yet another gap in our income. While we've taken many steps to save money where we can, the forecast is still grim for many months to come.

The offering today will support the All Souls general fund. I know many of us pledge regularly and generously to All Souls, but these additional offerings and gifts throughout the year help provide additional needed income to support our community and our mission. Today, I'm asking you to reflect upon the positive impact that this community has on our lives, and celebrate that with a gift to support the work of the church. The offering will now be given and gratefully received.
