Hello, my name is Russell Feldhausen and it is my honor to serve as the vice president of the All Souls Board of Trustees. I'm here today to share information about the upcoming All Souls Annual Meeting.

As required by article 4 of our constitution, we must hold an annual meeting of our society in May each year. This year's meeting will be held on Sunday, May 16th at 1:00 PM. The meeting itself will be held online using Zoom, so you'll be able to attend that meeting using a computer, tablet or smartphone, or you can even call in using a regular telephone. The information for joining on Zoom can be found on the main page of our website at allsoulskc.org - look for the "Community Connection" link. 

We also plan to broadcast the annual meeting via YouTube on the same channel we use for our Sunday services, so you can watch the meeting there as well. Look for the "All Souls UU Church KC YouTube Channel" link on our website. 

The purpose of the annual meeting will be to adopt an annual budget and to elect incoming members of the Board of Trustees and various church committees. In addition, we will be voting on several items, including a request for a grant from the endowment, a resolution regarding gender-neutral language in church documents, and a related amendment to the constitution and bylaws. 

To facilitate holding our annual meeting online, we have adopted a process to make sure every voting member is informed and able to cast a ballot. On Monday, May 3rd, an email will be sent to all certified voting members containing information about the meeting and how to cast your vote. If you do not receive this email, but believe you should have, please send an email to board@allsoulskc.org and we will look into it. Then, during or shortly after the annual meeting on May 16th, we will send a second email containing a link to a ballot form. That ballot must be submitted online within one hour of the end of the annual meeting in order for it to count as a vote cast at that meeting. However, if you run into any technology issues or prefer not to use the online form, we will provide information during the meeting for how to cast your vote via phone. We will then tabulate the results and share them with you as soon as they are available. 

Here are some next steps you'll want to be aware of as we get closer to the annual meeting. First, the Board of Trustees met for their regular meeting on April 21st. During that meeting, we created an approved an agenda for the annual meeting and also passed an annual budget presented from the finance committee to be presented to the congregation for approval. Those documents will be shared via the church newsletter and on our website. Next, please watch for an email on May 3rd from board@allsoulskc.org containing information about the meeting. Again, if you don't receive that email and believe you should have, contact us at board@allsoulskc.org and we'll look into it. Also, please take some time to review the presented agenda and budget, and let us know if you have any questions or concerns. Finally, make sure you mark your calendars for May 16th at one o'clock pm for the All Souls Annual Meeting. We hope to see you there. 

We hope that this process will allow everyone to attend the annual meeting and feel that their voice is heard. As always, if you have any questions, comments or concerns, please email the board at board@allsoulskc.org or reach out to any board member. Thank you.
