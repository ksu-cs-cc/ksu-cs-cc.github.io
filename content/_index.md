### What is the Computational Core?

The Computational Core is a set of computer programming courses designed to provide students of any major with the fundamental knowledge to utilize programming in a variety of situations. Programming is the skillset that makes students stand out in the 21st century job market and is beneficial in almost any field. The Computational Core includes high quality, state-of-the-art courses that are scalable and self-sustaining. These courses use cutting-edge online education frameworks allow students to work at their own pace, require students to master basic concepts before advancing, and provide immediate feedback and guidance while retaining personal interaction with teaching faculty and teaching assistants.

Certificate courses include:

CC 110 - Introduction to Computing  
CC 210 – Fundamental Computer Programming Concepts  
CC 310 – Data Structures & Algorithms  
CC 315 – Data Structures & Algorithms 2  
CC 410 – Advanced Programming

Additional courses are currently in development as part of a planned Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science. These courses will cover more advanced topics such as web development, data science, system administration, and database systems. More information regarding that program will be available in 2020.

### Free Sample Course

Are you a K-State student with interest in computer science but not sure if this program is right for you? Fill out this [brief questionnaire](https://kstate.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6DTTNZSxlEbIzBP) to sign up for a free sample course designed to introduce you to the program. The sample course includes the first module of CC 210 - Fundamental Computer Programming Concepts, as well as a look at the structure that is common across all Computational Core courses. At this time, the sample course is available only to current K-State students with a valid eID.
