### Course Description

This course is an introduction to the history, fundamental theories, basic programming, and research areas within Computing Science and its related disciplines. Computing Science has a direct impact on many facets of daily life, but very few of us ever take the time to wonder how it all works. This course aims to fill that void. 

To accomplish this goal, we will do several hands-on learning activities, have meaningful in-class discussions, write about our own thoughts and opinions on various subjects, and research topics that are central to Computing Science. While doing so, we will try to relate the concepts we are learning to real-world problems and ideas.  

{{% notice note %}}

Some hands-on learning will be limited due to COVID-19 this semester.

{{% /notice %}}

### Course Objectives
By the end of this course, each student will be able to:

- Describe the history of Computing Science and list some of the important devices, innovations, and people that got us to where we are today.
- Relate Computing Science to a variety of other disciplines and describe how they are interconnected with each other.
- Apply and use Computing Science tools and techniques to solve real-world problems.
- Research and learn about new ideas and areas in Computing Science and share those ideas with others, all without direct guidance.
- Develop a personal understanding of how Computing Science affects his or her own life.
- Understand many different subject areas within Computing Science and how they are changing our understanding of the field.

### Major Course Topics

- The history of Computing Science and early computing machines
- Computational thinking, programming, and algorithm design
- The history and technology behind the internet and how it affects our world
- Traditional Computing Science areas such as artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, high performance computing, big data, robotics, and more
- Cybersecurity in a modern, interconnected world
- Other disciplines and how they relate to Computing Science.

## Course Structure

In short, this course will focus on several learning activities designed to engage and interest students in a variety of topics while helping them think more deeply about each topic and why it is important in Computing Science. This class will require a considerable, but reasonable, amount of effort, not only from the students but the instructors and TAs as well. In addition to exercises and activities, there will be several assignments and group projects to be completed. 

{{% notice note%}}

The first two weeks of class will be 100% remote for sections D and E due to university COVID restrictions.

{{% /notice %}}

**CIS 115 is a studio-type course**, meaning that much of the course is done online.  <u>It is expected that you complete the online material/readings **before** you come to class</u> so we can have discussions on that weeks material. Class time will be dedicated to activities, discussions, and programming work. While most work for the course is available online, there will be some content that will be available **only** in class. There will be about two modules of content delivered each week, along with some Python programming content. Each module given will have a quiz over the content covered so it is important to stay caught up on module content each week (*see late policy below*)!

#### Attendance and Participation in Class Activities

**Attendance in class is required**. The majority of class periods will include hands-on/group activities to be completed in class that will help illustrate the topic of the day. Collaborating and communicating with others in the class is a large part of these activities and is encouraged. Participating in each of these activities is key to learning, so failing to attend class or complete in-class activities and labs will result in a reduced grade for that day’s work. ***Simply attending class does not guarantee that you will receive points\***

**Face coverings are required at ALL times** in class and walking about the engineering building.  If you are not wearing a face covering properly, you will be asked to either correctly put one on or leave the classroom. See the official statement on face coverings toward the end of this syllabus.  While there are not assigned seats, please try to sit in the same place every time you come to class.

**Need to miss a class?** Work will never be completely excused, however some exceptions/extensions can be given in 2 situations:

- You are absent due to a **university activity** and have given the instructor **prior notice** of the absence. Excuses after the absence will not be accepted, even for university activities

- You have a “major life event” that prevents you from completing class, such as an illness or family emergency. **These events must be verified through the K-State Office of Student Life**. Contact them **AS SOON AS YOU CAN** once you know you will be away from class. They will work with your instructors while you are gone. Contact your instructor once you are able to discuss make-up work and absences.

{{% notice note%}}
Attendance accommodations include all COVID related causes, but Student Life should still be some of the first people you contact.

### Assignments

{{% notice warning%}}
Assignments are to be completed without any collaboration with classmates or other outside help unless otherwise stated. Any unauthorized aid may result in a 0 for the assignment or an XF for the course and report submitted to the Academic Honor Council. 
{{% /notice %}}

There will be some programming or written assignments given from time to time that must be completed outside of class. It is acceptable to communicate with other students about the concepts in the assignment if you do not understand it, but you should not discuss the details of how the assignment should be completed. Your submission should be your own work, or the work of your small group if allowed by the instructor.  Some work will require you to look up certain programming syntax and techniques on the internet, **but** there is a fine line between learning and copying! ***When in doubt, ask!***

#### Grading
- 25% - Topic Research and Wiki Article
- 12.5% - Programming Homework (*Lowest score is dropped*)
- 12.5% - Programming Labs (*Lowest score is dropped*)
- 10% - Discussions (Lowest score is dropped)
- 40% - Quizzes (*Lowest two scores are dropped*)

Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale: 

90% - 100% - A; 80% - 89.99% - B; 70% - 79.99% - C; 60% - 69.99% - D; 00% - 59.99% - F 

#### Late Work

{{% notice warning%}}

Poor planning/procrastination on your part does not constitute as an emergency on ours.

{{% /notice %}}

Every student should strive to turn in work on time. **Late work will receive penalty of 10% of the possible points for each day it is late**. Some assignments will NOT be accepted late! Others will be limited to a maximum of three days late (not always 3 days). Missed class attendance cannot be made up, though as mentioned above some areas will drop the lowest two scores. If you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to make up missed work.

#### Programming Work

{{% notice warning%}}
Programming assignments that are turned in and do not run or that are not in the required format will receive a grade of 0, **no exceptions**. My recommendation to avoid making this mistake is to check your solution after you submitted it to Canvas. **Redownload** what you submitted from Canvas and run it again to assure that the program you submitted is working as intended.
{{% /notice %}}
There will be two primary types of programming assignments: homework and labs. <u>Labs</u> will be only available to be completed during designated class times unless otherwise stated. To get credit for completing a lab, you must have your work checked off by the professor or TA before leaving class.  Partial credit is awarded for labs started in class, but not completed in time. No credit is given for a lab if you do not attend class unless a prior arrangement is made given a valid reason (see attendance policy).  <u>Homework</u> will be mostly individual work unless otherwise stated and is intended to be done outside of class time.  Class time may be used for working on homework if you have completed the lab work for that class period. 

#### Team Assignments

Students will be assigned to a team at the beginning of the semester. Each team will be responsible for completing two major projects during the semester. Some group work will include a **REQUIRED** peer evaluation component which can adjust that portion of the individual’s grade up to 50%. If a student should fail to contribute to a group assignment at all, their grade for that assignment will be reduced to a zero. **Failure to complete the peer evaluation will result in a 10% grade deduction for that assignment**. Also note that all group work still should be completed in a socially distance environment, whether that be online or in-person while wearing masks.

#### Topic Research

Each team will be given a topic to research. The team will locate and organize materials to use when presenting the topic to the class. The materials should include both online and offline resources. The team will then create a presentation to share the information about their topic with the class. That research will then be used to write the wiki article.

#### Wiki Article
Each team will use the material collected for the topic research project, as well as information from the resulting class discussions, to create an article to be added to the final course wiki. The article is expected to be a thorough examination of the topic and should be written in such a way that others taking this course can read it and understand the material. The team will be responsible for finalizing the entire draft of the wiki and making sure it has a consistent design and feel to it. 

## Subject to Change

The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum. If any changes occur, the changes will be posted on the K-State Canvas page for this course and emailed to all students.

## Academic Honesty
Kansas State University has an Honor & Integrity System based on  personal integrity which is presumed to be sufficient assurance in  academic matters one's work is performed honestly and without  unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by  registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor & Integrity  System. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all  full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate  courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning.

A component vital to the Honor & Integrity System is the inclusion of the [Honor Pledge](https://www.k-state.edu/honor/basics/pledge.html) which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, *whether or not* it is stated: **"On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work."**

The default in this class is that ALL work will be accomplished  individually, UNLESS my permission is given in advance of an  assignment/quiz/exam/take-home exam/final. If you are in doubt, please  ask

A [grade of XF](https://www.k-state.edu/honor/faculty-tips/policy-agreement.html) can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure  in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.

For more information, visit the Honor & Integrity System home web page at: [http://www.k-state.edu/honor/](https://www.k-state.edu/honor/)

{{% notice warning %}}

The standard policy for this course, a violation of the Honor Pledge will result in an automatic 0 for the assignment and the violation will be reported to the Honor System. A second violation will result in an XF in the course. The sanctions will apply to **ALL** parties involved in the violation.

**Note that depending on the severity of the first violation, the sanction may be worse than just a 0 for the assignment**

## Expectations for Classroom Conduct

All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the [Student Judicial Conduct Code](http://www.k-state.edu/sga/judicial/) as outlined in the Student Governing Association [By Laws](http://www.k-state.edu/sga/old_files/sgadocs/ByLaws.pdf), Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class.

## Wearing of Face Coverings
To protect the health and safety of the  K-State community, students, faculty, staff and visitors must wear face  coverings over their mouths and noses in all indoor and outdoor spaces  while you are on university property unless you are alone in a private  office or workspace or alone outdoors. In addition, all new students are required to complete [face covering training](https://kstate.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eJ6LHbFIJ8GFD7f) that also covers COVID-19 transmission, risk mitigation and the Every  Wildcat a Wellcat pledge. Students needing accommodations may contact  the Student Access Center at [accesscenter@k-state.edu](mailto:accesscenter@k-state.edu).

In classrooms, faculty have the right to  deny a student entry into the room if the student is not wearing a face  covering. Students not wearing a face covering will be reminded to do so and offered a clean face covering, if one is available. If the student  does not comply, the faculty member will ask the student to leave the  space, and if available, join the class remotely. As a last resort,  campus police will be called. The faculty member will complete the [Code of Conduct form](https://www.k-state.edu/report/conduct-violation/) and the Office of Student Life will look further into the issue and take  the non-compliance with the request to leave into consideration of  further accountability measures. 

At no point should the  professor or other students put themselves into an unsafe situation  while attempting to enforce the face-covering policy.

## Academic Freedom Statement

Kansas State University is a community of students, faculty, and staff who work together to discover new knowledge, create new ideas, and share the results of their scholarly inquiry with the wider public. Although new ideas or research results may be controversial, or challenge established views, the health and growth of any society requires frank intellectual exchange. Academic freedom protects this type of free exchange and is thus essential to any university's mission. 

Moreover, academic freedom supports collaborative work in the pursuit of truth and the dissemination of knowledge in an environment of inquiry, respectful debate, and professionalism. Academic freedom is not limited to the classroom or to scientific and scholarly research, but extends to the life of the university as well as to larger social and political questions. It is the right and responsibility of the university community to engage with such issues.

## Campus Safety
Kansas State University is committed to providing a safe teaching and learning environment for faculty members and students. In order to enhance your safety in the unlikely case of a campus emergency make sure that you know where and how to quickly exit your classroom and how to follow any emergency directives. To view additional campus emergency information go to the University's main page (http://www.ksu.edu) and click on the Emergency Information button.

## Weapons Policy Statement

Kansas State University prohibits the possession and use of firearms, explosives, and other weapons on any University campus, with certain limited exceptions, which include use of weapons as part of approved University Programs, use of weapons by law enforcement personnel, and the lawful concealed carrying of handguns, as provided in the weapons policy, which may be found at: http://www.k-state.edu/police/weapons/index.html

## Concealed Carry Statement

Under the Weapons Policy, individuals who carry a concealed handgun must have the handgun on or about their person at all times. Backpacks are appropriate for carrying a handgun as long as the backpack remains within the exclusive and uninterrupted control of the individual. A backpack or other bag used to carry a handgun must be within the immediate reach of the individual. Before bringing a concealed carry handgun into a University building, individuals who choose to carry a concealed handgun in a backpack, bag, etc., should consider whether or not they may be required to be separated from their handgun, such as being asked to go to the front of a classroom or to store bags in a particular area in a lab or exam room. In this course, the instructor may require students to place backpacks or other bags out of reach for safety or other reasons. The instructor will notify students in advance of this requirement so a student who carries a concealed handgun in a backpack or a bag may take steps to conceal the handgun on his or her person before arriving, or otherwise plan accordingly.

 *In this class, students will be asked on a regular basis to participate in activities, such as engaging in group work, using the board, etc. These activities may require students to either be separated from their bags or be prepared to keep their bags with them at all times during such activities. Students are encouraged to take the online weapons policy education module (*[*http://www.k-state.edu/police/weapons/index.html*](http://www.k-state.edu/police/weapons/index.html) *) to ensure they understand the requirements related to concealed carry.*
