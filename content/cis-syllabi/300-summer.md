<iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?height=600&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%23ffffff&amp;ctz=America%2FChicago&amp;src=azJ2azdlZGNmbWVhYmViZ3BwMWdiY2EzdDhAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ&amp;src=MWZmcTd1N2RkM2Z0dDFycms2N2YzcHY4cGdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ&amp;color=%23AD1457&amp;color=%23616161&amp;showTitle=0&amp;mode=WEEK" style="border:solid 1px #777" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

In order to manage office hours during busy times, we will use an online queueing system. If all available TAs are busy when you're needing their help, add yourself to the queue using the following link:

- [CIS 300 Help Queue](https://officehours.cs.ksu.edu/groupsession/2)

You will then be notified when a TA is ready to help you.

## Required Textbook

[*Data Structures in C#* ](https://cis300.cs.ksu.edu/), Rod Howell.

## Recommended Textbook

If you would like to refer to a textbook on programming in C#, I can recommend:

- *Programming in the Key of C#: A Primer for Aspiring Programmers*, Charles Petzold.

## Prerequisite

The prerequisites for this course are CIS 200 and either MATH 205 or  MATH 220. A grade of a C or better is required for each prerequisite. If you do not meet the prerequisite requirement for this course, you  should see me immediately, or you will be dropped from the course.

## Learning Outcomes

Students should attain competence in:

- Using interfaces to (partially) define a data structure
- Implementing and using standard versions of classic data structures: lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables
- Implementing and using elementary algorithms for searching and manipulating a data structure
- Using recursion, including recursive definitions of data structures like lists and trees
- Using and implementing algorithms for sorting
- Understanding performance differences between various algorithms and data structures

## Programming Environment

The development environment to be used in this class is Microsoft Visual Studio 2022. This software is available on the Windows machines in the public labs in Engineering Hall 1114, 1116, and 1118, as well as [remotely](https://support.cs.ksu.edu/CISDocs/wiki/Remote_Access). Please note that some of these labs are reserved for classroom use at certain times of the day - be sure to check the schedules posted by the doors.

It is encouraged to install the software on your own PC. You can download it for free from the Microsoft Azure Portal. Please refer to "[Installing Visual Studio](https://cis300.cs.ksu.edu/appendix/vs/installing-vs/)" for more details.

## Grading

{{% notice warning%}}
It is crucial that all work you do is your own. For this course, a violation of the Honor Pledge will result (at minimum) in an automatic 0 for the assignment or an XF for the course and the violation will be reported to the Honor System. Posting (even if you don't get a response) course content on Stack Overflow, Chegg, or other similar websites is expressly forbidden. This includes viewing posts as well. It also includes viewing solutions to course content that has not been provided to you through canvas by your instructor or TA. A violation of this policy will result in an immediate XF for the course.

*If you are struggling in the course or you have doubts on something, please ask!  Your instructor and TA are here to help!*
{{% /notice %}}

- Lab assignments: 20%
- Homework assignments: 30%
- Weekly online quizzes: 50%

#### Lab Assignments

An average of 5 lab assignment will be assigned during each week. These assignments will each be due at the end of the week; however, it is reccomended to follow the suggested completion dates on the course schedule to help with time management. Each lab assignment will be worth 2 points:

- 1 point for making a legitimate attempt at completing the assignment.
- 1 point for fully implementing correct functionality.

The lowest five lab scores will not be counted toward your final grade - no other lab absences will be excused.

Prior to each lab, you will be expected to read some background  material, watch a video, and take a review quiz to check your  understanding of some key points. The review quizzes will not count toward your grade; however, you will not be able to begin the lab assignment until you have answered all questions in the review quiz correctly.

#### Homework Assignments

Five programming assignments will be given as homework during the  course of the semester. All solutions must be submitted electronically by the given due date. Late submissions will be accepted with a penalty of 1% per hour, or any portion of an hour, late; thus, if a submission is 1 minute late, the penalty is 1%. If multiple solutions are submitted for the same assignment, only the last one will be graded. No  submissions will be accepted after three days (i.e., 72 hours) past the  due date. The first four homework assignments will each be worth 5% of  the final grade. The fifth homework assignment will be a final project, due during Finals Week; it will be worth 10% of the final grade.

#### Weekly Quizzes

An online quiz will be given at the end of most weeks. Each quiz will emphasize the material from that week, but may also include material from previous weeks. Normally, a quiz will be made available on a Saturday morning, and must be completed within 30 minutes of your  beginning the quiz. It will typically be due on Monday at 11:59 p.m. Any deviations from this schedule will be posted in announcements on  Canvas. **There will be no quiz the first week.**

Each quiz will involve solving a short programming problem. You will  be allowed to use course notes and Visual Studio to complete the quiz.  Your lowest quiz score will not be counted toward your final grade.

#### Grading Scale

Final grades will be assigned according to the following scale:

- 90%-100%: A
- 80%-89%: B
- 70%-79%: C
- 60%-69%: D
- Below 60%: F

## Course Delivery

Details regarding the delivery of this course are given in the [Course Introduction](https://k-state.instructure.com/courses/113130/modules/436216) module. In order to make sure you understand the delivery mechanisms, you must obtain a perfect score on the quiz in that module before you can begin the course material. You can take this quiz as many times as  you need to get a perfect score. The score will **not** count toward your final grade. 

## Canvas

All assignments and other course materials will be distributed via [Canvas ](http://canvas.ksu.edu). Grade information may be accessed there, and announcements will be posted from time to time. Important class messages will be emailed to your KSU email addresses and posted as announcements. **You must be enrolled in the course to access Canvas.**

## Microsoft Teams

All students in this class have been added to the team, "KSU CIS 300 Fall 2021". You can access Microsoft Teams at [teams.microsoft.com ](http://teams.microsoft.com), or you may [download the Microsoft Teams app ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app). You will need to login using your KSU eID. One or more forums will be  available in Teams to facilitate public discussions with the CIS 300  instructional staff and your classmates. **Please don't post your code to these forums.**

## How to Succeed in This Course

- **Prepare for labs.** Preparatory videos, readings, and slides will be available for each lab assignment. Taking some time to familiarize yourself with the material will help you to do well on the lab assignments, as well as to learn more from the lab experience.

- **Complete the lab assignments.** Simply by attempting at least 35 of the 40 labs and following the programming style requirements will get you roughly 1/2 of the total points allotted to lab assignments. Furthermore, by trying, you will undoubtedly complete many of them, which will earn you even more points. Finally, what you learn from this experience will help you to do well on the homework and the quizzes.

- **Don't be afraid to ask for help.** While there is value in figuring things out on your own, sometimes a little help can go a long way. If you seem to be stuck on something, or if something in the instructions doesn't make sense to you, ask for help from me or one of the lab assistants - that's what we're there for.

- **Start assignments early.** Programming usually takes longer than you expect. A good plan for the lab assignments is to work on them during each scheduled lab time, utilizing the help available as needed. Homework assignments will require much more time than lab assignments. Starting early will help you to complete the assignments on time.

- **Review model solutions.** Even if you completed the assignment, seeing how I did it can help you to learn more.
